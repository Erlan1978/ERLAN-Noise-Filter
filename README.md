# ERLAN-Noise-Filter
ERLAN (Enhanced Regression Layers for Adaptive Noise Filtering) is a lightweight model for noise filtering in data such as audio, images, and tabular data.

📌 Description
ERLAN-Noise-Filter uses advanced regression layers for adaptive noise suppression across different data types. The model analyzes input data and automatically reduces noise levels while preserving valuable information.

🚀 Features
Support for multimodal data (audio, images, tabular data)
Adaptive noise filtering
Easy integration into existing ML pipelines
Optimized performance
📂 Installation
