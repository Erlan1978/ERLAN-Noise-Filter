# ERLAN-Noise-Filter
ERLAN (Enhanced Regression Layers for Adaptive Noise Filtering) is a lightweight model for noise filtering in data such as audio, images, and tabular data.

📌 Description
ERLAN-Noise-Filter uses advanced regression layers for adaptive noise suppression across different data types. The model analyzes input data and automatically reduces noise levels while preserving valuable information.

🚀 Features
Support for multimodal data (audio, images, tabular data)
Adaptive noise filtering
Easy integration into existing ML pipelines
Optimized performance
📂 Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

🛠 Usage
Example usage in Python:

python
from erlan import NoiseFilter

# Initialize the model
filter = NoiseFilter()

# Filter the data
clean_data = filter.denoise(noisy_data)

🔧 CI/CD
The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
